# bim-solver

Bimetric 3+1 Toolkit implements the standard 3+1 evolution and the covariant BSSN evolution schemes for
spherically symmetric bimetric and GR spacetimes.

The project goal is the construction of a computational toolkit for the evolution of
3+1 equations of **modified theories of gravity** in spherical symmetry, at the same
time resembling the functionality of the EinsteinToolkit to ease transition to the
full scale projects. The current implementation handles bimetric and GR spacetimes.

Note that the toolkit can handle any system of differential equations.
For a pedagogical example how to use the toolkit, see
[Gowdy spacetimes solver][gowdy-link].
